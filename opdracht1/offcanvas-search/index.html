        <h1>Discourse</h1>
        I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himselfâ€”I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me...
